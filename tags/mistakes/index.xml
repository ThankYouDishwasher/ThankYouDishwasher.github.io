            This is a case happening in unit testing. Any changes and console.log couldn&amp;rsquo;t be reflected in the testing log. It finally turned out that the testing was referencing a JS file complied as the route I imported didn&amp;rsquo;t have a suffix, and by default, the JS files will be consumed.
In order to reduce the noises caused by JS files, you can run yarn clean
